## **Flask Application Design for a vLLM Powered Chatbot**

---

## HTML Files:

**1. `index.html`:**
   - The entry point of the application.
   - Contains the user interface for interacting with the chatbot, such as an input field for the user's message and a display area for the chatbot's responses.
   - Includes necessary HTML elements, like forms and JavaScript for handling user input.

**2. `chat.html`:**
   - The primary page for displaying the chatbot's responses.
   - Contains a dynamic area where the chatbot's responses are loaded using AJAX requests.
   - Includes styles and layout elements for a visually appealing chat interface.

## Routes:

**1. `home`:**
   - Maps to the root URL (`/`).
   - Serves the `index.html` file, displaying the initial user interface for the chatbot.

**2. `chat`:**
   - Handles AJAX requests for generating chatbot responses.
   - Receives the user's message as input.
   - Interacts with the vLLM model to generate a response.
   - Returns the generated response as JSON data to the client.

**3. `static`:**
   - Serves static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.
   - Ensures that the client can access the necessary resources for styling and functionality.
